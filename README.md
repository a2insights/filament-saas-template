# Filament SaaS

## A stable version is coming.
All changes in the database during the beta versions need to be updated manually. In the first stable versions, I will not introduce several breaking changes without migrations.

# Overview
This repository provides a robust template for building scalable, multi-tenant SaaS applications. It addresses the common challenges faced in multi-tenant development, such as:

Diverse models: Tailored solutions for varying application requirements.
Database complexities: Support for multiple database models (e.g., multi-tenant per database, schema per tenant).
Resource heterogeneity: Accommodation for diverse hardware configurations.
By leveraging this template, you can quickly establish a solid foundation for your SaaS project. It offers a modular structure, supports various multi-tenancy models, and integrates seamlessly with popular databases.

### Need help customizing the template to your specific needs? Reach out to me! I can assist you in selecting the optimal architecture and technologies for your project.

## Key features:

Flexibility: Adapts to different use cases and requirements.
Scalability: Designed to handle growing user bases.
Security: Protects user data.

## The big problem: [Livewire+Filament+TenancyForLaravel]

We use Tenancy for Laravel to load the tenant context, but there is a significant issue when using the public or local filesystem driver. https://github.com/archtechx/tenancy/issues/1212. I haven't been able to resolve this and make file uploads work in tenant mode—it only works in non-tenant mode. However, if you're using the S3 driver in production, it works perfectly.

I recommend using a single bucket for all tenants because I tested and verified that it works. There are many tricky issues to pinpoint. I’ve already spent several hours trying to make it work locally in tenant mode but failed. I will wait for further improvements in the package https://tenancyforlaravel.com/ or consider dropping it soon. Since this has not been a problem in production where I use AWS S3 for file storage, I don’t plan to address it for now. However, if you know how to resolve this, feel free to share a solution.
